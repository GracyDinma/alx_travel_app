Creating Models, Serializers, and Seeders

In a travel booking platform, developers need to design data structures for listings (properties available for booking), customer bookings, and user reviews. Serializers ensure this data can be delivered via APIs to mobile or web clients. During development, seeding the database with sample listings allows frontend developers and testers to work with realistic data without manually creating entries, significantly speeding up the development lifecycle and ensuring consistent test scenarios.
